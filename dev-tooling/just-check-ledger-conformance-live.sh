# IOResult so that an UNREADABLE `.livespec.jsonc` is distinguishable from a repo
# that legitimately configures no wrapper. Both still SKIP — see the fail-soft
# contract in the justfile; this recipe runs on EVERY push and a false-fail would
# brick them all — but they are no longer REPORTED as the same thing.
#
# ⛔ THE OLD LINE DISCARDED THE DISTINCTION EVEN WHEN PYTHON HAD IT: `2>/dev/null`
# plus a bare empty-array fallback mapped every failure onto "no wrapper". That is
# why fixing the Python alone would have changed nothing observable.
