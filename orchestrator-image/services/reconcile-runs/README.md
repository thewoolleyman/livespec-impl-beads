# `reconcile-runs` host timer

Committed unit TEXT for the periodic reconciliation of every declared factory's
non-terminal run inventory against the ledger. Installing it on a host is a
separate operator action; nothing in this repository installs it.

## Why a timer, when the dispatch path already reconciles

`dispatch_preamble` runs one reconciliation pass at the head of every
`dispatcher.py dispatch` and every `loop` tick. That covers the host while it is
dispatching, and only while it is dispatching. A host whose queue has drained
still holds every orphaned Fabro run it launched, and an orphan holds a
scheduler slot until something looks at it — so the interval with no dispatches
is exactly the interval with nobody watching. The timer is what closes it.

## Install

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --repo /data/projects/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro
```

`--plugin-root` defaults to this repository's `.claude-plugin/`; `--user`
defaults to the invoking user. `install.sh` REFUSES (exit 78) when the project
env wrapper named in the service's `ExecStart` is not an executable file on the
host: without it `bd` runs with no `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD` and every pass fails as
`Access denied` / `no beads database found`, which reads as an absent tenant
rather than an absent credential.

Set `LIVESPEC_ENV_WRAPPER` when a host keeps the wrapper somewhere other than
the path the committed unit names; the installer both requires and writes that
path. `UNIT_DIR` and `DRY_RUN=1` exist for rehearsal and for this repository's
own tests.

## Verify

```bash
systemctl list-timers reconcile-runs.timer --no-pager
journalctl -u reconcile-runs.service -n 50 --no-pager
```

Each pass also appends one `reconcile-runs-pass` record to the repository's
dispatch journal (`tmp/fabro-dispatch-journal.jsonl`) naming the factories
surveyed, the orphans found and reconciled, and the errors — so a pass that
found nothing is distinguishable from a pass that never ran.
