"""The workflow-variant name a work-item is pinned to, across retries.

Beside `_store_dispatch_factory` rather than inside it, because the two keys
do NOT share one fate. `dispatch_factory` is written twice per dispatch from
two different moments and therefore carries two stored shapes, which is the
whole reason that module keeps its writers together. `dispatch_workflow` is
one plain name written at one moment -- when the variant resolves, before the
run exists -- so folding it in would file a single-shape key under a docstring
explaining a two-writer invariant it does not have.

It is read through this module directly rather than re-exported from
`store.py`, exactly as `_dispatcher_run_stamp` reads `_store_dispatch_factory`:
the facade carries the broad WorkItem API its many callers share, and one
consumer reaching one store concern does not need to widen it.

WHY THE PIN EXISTS AT ALL. A retry of a work-item must re-run the SAME graph
the first attempt ran: `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` section "Named workflow
variants" resolves the recorded name ahead of `dispatcher.default_workflow`
precisely so a default changed between attempts cannot silently move a
half-finished item onto a different workflow.
