"""Cross-dispatch persistence of a degraded post-merge step outcome.

A degraded outcome that only ever affected the dispatch that produced it would
degrade silently on every dispatch forever: the janitor never runs, nobody is
refused, and the missing integration point is never provided. So the degradation
PERSISTS -- the journal is the durable carrier, and the NEXT dispatch for the
repository reads it back and refuses at the pre-dispatch gate until either a
re-verification observes the integration point provided or a committed waiver
covers the step. The hard refusal IS the mechanism that makes the adopter
provide the missing piece.

THE JOURNAL IS THE STATE, deliberately. The alternative -- a sidecar marker file
-- would be a second source of truth that can disagree with the record everyone
audits, and would need its own lifecycle. The journal already carries every
outcome, is append-only, and is what an operator reads; reading it back costs one
pass over a file this dispatch is about to append to anyway.

WHY THE CLEARING IS ITS OWN RECORD rather than the absence of a later
degradation. A refusal that ended by nothing happening would be unauditable: an
operator asking "why did this start dispatching again?" would find no answer.
The clearing record names the step identifier and the degraded outcome record it
clears, so the refusal's end is as durable as its start.

An outcome record is addressed by the envelope timestamp the append layer
stamps, together with the work-item it belongs to. That reference is stable
because the journal is append-only: the line it names never moves and is never
rewritten.
