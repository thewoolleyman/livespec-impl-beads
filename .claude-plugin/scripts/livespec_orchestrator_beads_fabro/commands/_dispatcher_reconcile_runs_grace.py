"""The bounded slot hold for a run parked in a human-input-required state.

The reconciler's moot-question join releases a run the LEDGER has finished
with — the item left `active`, a newer dispatch superseded it, the item is
absent entirely. A run parked at a human gate whose item is STILL LIVE is a
different object: nobody has answered its question, and nothing in the ledger
says the answer stopped mattering. The join therefore leaves it alone, which
is exactly how one parked run held an hp scheduler slot for 164 minutes.

`dispatcher.blocked_run_grace_seconds` bounds that hold without pretending to
answer the question. Past the grace the run is exported and abandoned; the
work-item is left EXACTLY as it was, so the decision keeps waiting in the
ledger, which is the only place a human decision ever waits.

TWO FAIL-CLOSED CHOICES, both leaning toward NOT terminating.

An UNMEASURABLE park is never reaped. The parked duration is read off the
run's own record, and a record carrying none of `PARKED_SINCE_KEYS` yields
`None` rather than a guess. Such a run is still REPORTED as held — a hold
nobody can see is the failure this module exists to end — but it is not
terminated.

`start_time` is deliberately NOT one of those keys, and that is the one
judgement call worth naming. A run's AGE is an upper bound on how long it has
been parked, never the park itself: a run that started three hours ago and
parked a minute ago reads as three hours old. Measuring the park from the
run's start would reap a run parked for seconds, which is the expensive
direction. Every key below names the instant the run entered the state it is
now sitting in, so the difference from now IS the park.

Which key the pinned Fabro build (0.254.0) actually emits was NOT verifiable
where this was written: the implementation sandbox reached no factory, and no
captured `inspect` payload exists anywhere in this repo. The list is therefore
ordered most-specific-first and treated as a SEARCH rather than as a known
schema — and the fail-closed default is what makes an unmatched schema safe.
An unrecognised record leaves today's behaviour (held, reported, never
terminated) instead of reaping on a misread number.

The `dispatcher.blocked_run_grace_seconds` READ lives here rather than beside
the other dials in `_dispatcher_policy_settings.py`, through that module's own
public `read_dispatcher_config_value` seam — the route it documents for a
setting whose coercion is cohesive with its consumer rather than with the
reader (`dispatcher.minimum_release` sits with its floor for the same reason).
Two things make it the right home rather than the convenient one. The coercion
genuinely is peculiar to this arm: `0` is a MEANINGFUL value here and not a
degenerate one, so this setting floors at zero where every other bound in that
module floors at one. And that module stood at 242 LLOC against a 250 hard
ceiling, so the eleven lines this read costs would have breached it — a split
of that module along its own `effective_*` seam was a separate change, not a
rider on this one. That split has since landed (the per-item resolvers now sit
in `_dispatcher_policy_overrides.py`), so the size argument is spent; the
coercion argument above is what still keeps this read here.
