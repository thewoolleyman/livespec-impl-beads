"""The pre-dispatch gate for the closed step set: preflights, waivers, persistence.

One entry point, `step_discipline_refusal`, runs the whole discipline for a
dispatch: each pre-dispatch preflight in turn, then the cross-dispatch
persistence check for any degraded post-merge outcome still standing. It returns
the operator-facing refusal text when the dispatch must not proceed, and None
when it may -- having journaled, either way, every outcome it produced.

WHY THE PREFLIGHTS ARE YIELDED LAZILY. A refusal must stop the sequence: the
master-CI preflight makes forge calls, and running them after the source
checkout has already refused spends network on an answer nobody will read.
A generator gives sequential evaluation without a hand-rolled early-return
ladder that would have to be re-read every time a fourth step is ratified.

WHY THE PERSISTENCE CHECK RUNS LAST. Its re-verification for a pre-dispatch step
is that step's own preflight passing THIS dispatch, so it has to run after them.
That is also the honest reading: those two steps verify themselves on every
dispatch, and `janitor-bootstrap` -- which cannot, because it only observes
after a merge -- gets the explicit recipe-presence check instead.
