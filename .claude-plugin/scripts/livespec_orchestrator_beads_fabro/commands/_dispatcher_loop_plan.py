"""Per-item `DispatchPlan` construction for the dispatch loop.

Split out of `_dispatcher_loop` by cohesion: everything here answers "what
does THIS item's run look like" — where its per-dispatch scratch files live,
which janitor checkout it gets, which factory it goes to, its effective
review-fix policy, and the subprocess ceiling derived from its resolved node
timeouts. `_dispatcher_loop` is left with the other concern, driving the
dispatch and routing each pre-run refusal to its own journal stage.
