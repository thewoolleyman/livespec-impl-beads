"""Registered-install currency: is this SESSION executing the build its repository resolves?

A Claude Code session binds its plugin root ONCE, at session start, and keeps
it for the session's whole life. The install registry moves underneath it on
every `claude plugin update`, so a session older than the last update
dispatches through a build the operator has already replaced -- with no
warning of its own, and with a failure shape that reads as a factory outage.
Measured 2026-09-06: a three-day-old session dispatched livespec-overseer work
through a v0.124.1 cache build (the one installed build that templates the
sandbox prepare steps but predates the host-side substitution fix released in
v0.124.3) while that repository's registered install was already v0.129.1;
the run died at sandbox setup and was reported fleet-wide as a workflow-config
regression.

This is a DIFFERENT question from the release-staleness warning beside it.
That one asks whether the executing build lags the newest release, which an
operator may legitimately have declined to adopt. This one asks whether the
executing build lags what the operator DID adopt for this repository, which
only a stale session can produce -- so its remedy is a restart, never a
`claude plugin update` (bd-ib-97v4: an update cannot move a running session).

Like every ambient currency finding it is SURFACED, never enforced (the
ratified currency contract): the one blocking form remains the committed
`dispatcher.minimum_release` floor. A registry that cannot be read, a
repository with no registered install, and a build whose manifest does not
parse are each recorded UNDETERMINED, never as current.

Identity is read from each build's `plugin.json`, never from the cache
directory name, for the reasons `_needs_attention_release_adoption` records.
