"""Enrich the `resolve-blocked` valve with the terminated run's own account.

An item resting at `blocked / needs-human` already produces exactly one
attention item — the `resolve-blocked:<item-id>:ready` valve lane in
`_needs_attention_work_items.human_valves`. Until now that item carried the
work-item's TITLE and nothing else, so the console offered a decision without
offering anything to decide on: not why the loop gave up, not which run it
was, not whether the work survived.

This module supplies the missing half by reading the run the ledger already
names. Contract v093 means that run is TERMINATED — it did not park and it
cannot be resumed — so the read is pure enrichment of a decision the ledger
has already routed, and the answer stays the existing valve. No attach route,
no resume route, and no second attention item: b3.S2 extends `resolve-blocked`
itself.

FAIL-SOFT IS THE WHOLE POSTURE HERE, and it is what makes the enrichment safe
to attach to a lane that already works. Every step — the ledger read for the
run id, the factory resolution, the `fabro inspect`, the parse — can come back
empty, and each one degrades to the summary the lane would have rendered
anyway. An unreachable factory must cost the enrichment, never the valve: the
human decision is already waiting, and a lane that vanished because a network
read failed would read downstream as a decision that had been made.

TWO READS DECIDE WHICH SERVER IS QUERIED, and the order matters. The item's
own `dispatch_factory` stamp names the factory its run actually went to; the
repository's configured default is the fallback. Resolving the stamped name
through `resolve_fabro_factory` — rather than reading a server url off the
stamp — keeps the target byte-identical to the one a dispatch to that name
would use, and means an undeclared factory resolves to no server and is
skipped rather than queried on a guess. Inspecting the default host for a run
that lives on another is the wrong-population probe this repository
catalogues: it returns cleanly and finds nothing.
