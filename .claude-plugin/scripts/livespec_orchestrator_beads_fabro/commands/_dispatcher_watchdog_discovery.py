"""Per-poll run-discovery for the coarse stall watchdog, and its observability.

The watchdog cannot key its liveness probe on a known run id: `fabro run`
is BLOCKING and only yields the run id on RETURN, i.e. after the run has
already finished. So every 30s poll RE-DISCOVERS the in-flight run by
attributing each `fabro ps -a --json --server <factory>` row to a work-item
through `_run_attribution` — the ledger's own run-id stamp once the dispatch
has written one, and the goal-text regex until then. That re-discovery is the
watchdog's single point of failure,
and it used to fail SILENTLY: a poll that matched nothing returned None,
the watch loop hit a bare `continue`, `decide_stall` was never consulted,
and the watchdog no-opped with ZERO output. Measured: that hid a TOTAL
watchdog outage on the `hp` remote factory for 11 days — the console
journal's entire history carries zero stall-cancel records — because a
blind watchdog and a watchdog watching a healthy run look identical from
outside.

The discovery step therefore lives HERE rather than in the launcher, as
one function that classifies AND journals: the "every poll is recorded"
guarantee is the point of the seam, and a caller that could take the
classification without the record would reintroduce the blind spot one
call site at a time.

Every failure mode the discovery step can take is a distinct `reason`, so
"the watchdog is blind" is a queryable state rather than an absence:

* `matched` — a ps row for this work-item is `runnable`/`running`.
* `ps-exit-nonzero` — the `fabro ps` probe itself failed; nothing was
  observed, so no conclusion about the run can be drawn.
* `no-ps-rows` — ps succeeded and listed NOTHING at all (a factory-wide
  observation, not an observation about this run).
* `work-item-id-mismatch` — ps listed rows, none carrying this work-item
  id. This is the leading hypothesis for the 11-day outage: a remote ps
  listing that omits an in-flight run mid-flight. `unattributed_row_count`
  discriminates it from the OTHER way this reason arises — a row that IS
  the run, whose goal text the id regex failed to attribute.
* `status-kind-not-running` — rows for this work-item exist but none is in
  a state the watchdog may act on (e.g. already terminal).

The evidence counters ride ALONGSIDE the reason deliberately: a reason
alone says which branch was taken, while the counters say what was
actually seen, which is what a later diagnosis of a discovery blind spot
needs. `classify_discovery` is a pure function of the ps result, so the
hermetic tier drives every branch without launching a real Fabro run; the
journal append through the injected writer is this module's only effect,
and the `fabro ps` call itself stays with the launcher that owns the port.
