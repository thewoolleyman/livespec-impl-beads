"""How a master-CI preflight outcome READS: its operator text and its journal record.

Split out of `_dispatcher_ci_preflight` along the cohesion seam between
DECIDING an outcome -- the lookups and the classification, which stay there --
and SAYING it, which is all this module does.

THE REMEDY PROSE IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF OF THE FAIL-OPEN RETIREMENT. Making
an unverifiable host refuse instead of proceed is only safe if the refusal tells
the operator how to get moving again; a refusal that merely says "unprovable"
parks an adopter with no route out and earns itself an env-var bypass within the
week. So every unprovable refusal built here names BOTH the direct remedy and
the committed `dispatcher.step_waivers` escape -- the sanctioned way a
repository that genuinely cannot verify proceeds, visibly and with an owner,
rather than silently.

Both sanctioned non-waived outcomes of a pre-dispatch step are journaled: a
PASS is a record, not an absence (`SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`, the
dispatch-preflight step discipline).
