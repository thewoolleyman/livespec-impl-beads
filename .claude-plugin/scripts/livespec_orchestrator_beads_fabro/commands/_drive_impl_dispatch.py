"""The `impl:<id>` dispatch transport of the drive operator surface.

Split out of `drive.py` along its cohesion seam: `drive.py` is the CLI
supervisor and action ROUTER (parse, refuse, pick a handler, render), while
this module is the one handler that shells out — it builds the
`dispatcher.py loop` argv, runs it through the injected `CommandRunner`, and
maps the Dispatcher's exit code and JSON onto a drive result payload.

`CommandRun` and the `CommandRunner` protocol live here because they are the
transport's own vocabulary; `drive.py` imports them back so its published
surface is unchanged.

    Each ACP adapter override becomes its own `--acp-node NODE=ADAPTER`
    pair, so the value reaches the Dispatcher as a single argv element and
    an adapter carrying spaces survives without quoting games.

    `--workflow-name` is re-emitted the same way and for the same reason the
    ACP overrides are: the workflow-variant selector is a recorded ARGUMENT
    and never an environment variable, so the only route from this operator
    surface to the Dispatcher is the argv this function builds — which is
    also what the drive result payload publishes back. Omitted entirely when
    unselected, so the Dispatcher's own ledger-then-default precedence
    resolves it rather than being pre-empted by an empty string.

    An ASSERTED identity (flag or environment) is forwarded as an explicit
    `--invoker` so the spawned Dispatcher records the operator, not the shell
    that spawned it. A FALLBACK identity is deliberately NOT forwarded: it is a
    mark meaning "nobody asserted", and passing it as a flag would relabel it
    `flag`-sourced — laundering an unattributed act into an asserted one, and
    defeating `require_invoker` downstream into the bargain.
