"""The seam the loop probe drives, and its production wiring.

The loop-probe clause of `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` requires the probe to run
through the SAME published machinery an ordinary dispatch uses, never a parallel
path. This module is what makes that requirement checkable: the probe talks to
ONE narrow protocol, and the production implementation of that protocol is a
thin composition of the already-published dispatch and reconcile surfaces. A
probe that reached for a private code path would have to change this file to do
it, which is exactly the visibility the clause is after.

The protocol is split into three ORDERED methods rather than one `drive` call
because the confinement contract lives in the SPLIT. `publish` drives the item
to a published change and reports its paths; the probe verifies confinement on
those paths; only then is `merge` called. An escape therefore fails the probe
with `merge` never invoked -- "fails without merging" is a property of the call
graph, not a promise in a docstring.

WHAT THE PRODUCTION WIRING CAN AND CANNOT INTERPOSE ON, stated plainly because
it decides how much the pre-merge leg is worth. The factory's own publish node
opens and merges the pull request, so `publish` can return a change that is
ALREADY merged upstream; `ProbePublish.merge_commit` carries that when it
happens. What the Dispatcher does own is the merge-COMPLETING disposition -- the
post-merge janitor and the acceptance path -- and that is what `merge` performs,
withheld until confinement is verified. The residual case, a change that merged
upstream anyway, is precisely what the post-merge backstop names, which is why
the contract ratifies both legs rather than either alone.
