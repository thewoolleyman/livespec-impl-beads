"""The `reject` human valve — the one valve that also rewrites the repository.

Split out of `_drive_valves` when that module reached the file-LLOC ceiling,
along the seam its own machinery already drew. Every other valve is a ledger
write and nothing else; `reject` alone shells out to `git revert` on the
`regroom` arm, carries the runner Protocol that indirection needs, and is the
only valve whose SUCCESS is journaled. All three exist for this action and
nothing else, so they travel with it rather than sitting in the router.

The router keeps `runner` in its own signature and forwards it here, which is
why `HumanValveRunner` is public: a caller injecting a fake command runner
reaches the valve through `run_human_valve_action`, never directly.
