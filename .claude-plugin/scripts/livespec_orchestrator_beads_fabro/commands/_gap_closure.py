"""Gap-tied closure verification: check-path-anchored, never gap_id-anchored.

Replaces the unsatisfiable `implement` Step 5a re-detection gate (F3):
detection is spec-only (`detect-impl-gaps` reads spec text, never
implementation state), so a `gap_id` disappears only when spec TEXT
changes — the old gate rewarded editing the spec instead of implementing.

Closure of a `gap-tied` work-item is instead anchored to a check PATH
recorded on the work-item's own beads metadata (never `gap_id`: F4 —
`gap_id` hashes a hard-wrapped source line, so reflowing a paragraph with
zero semantic change re-keys it and orphans the anchor exactly when the
clause is edited). The recorded check is a generic executable —
`main() -> int` convention, invoked once normally (must exit 0 to pass)
and once with `--negative-control` (must exit non-zero, proving the check
can fail and is therefore discriminating, not vacuously true). If the
check file's content differs from the baseline blob hash recorded when it
was cited, that is machine-detectable evidence the check was modified —
the common and most dangerous case being "loosen the check to make it
pass" — and closure is refused until a targeted drift propose-change is
recorded for this item.
