"""The git/forge reads the master-CI preflight makes, and the shapes they return.

Split out of `_dispatcher_master_ci_preflight` along the seam between ASKING —
which argv, which timeout, which payload key — and CLASSIFYING what came back,
which stays there. The two change for different reasons: a `gh` output-shape
change touches only this module, and a policy change about what counts as proof
touches only the classifier.

THE DEFAULT-BRANCH RESOLUTION IS NO LONGER HERE. It began in this module, as the
preflight's own replacement for a hard-coded branch literal, and it now lives in
`_dispatcher_default_branch` because a SECOND dispatch-path stage -- the factory
workflow-file guard -- asks the same question, and the ratified clause has the
dispatch path reuse one resolution rather than each caller carrying its own. The
preflight imports it from there; nothing about what it does changed.
