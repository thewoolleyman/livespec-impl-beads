"""Export an orphaned run's record before anything terminates it.

The maintainer's 2026-08-26 ruling is that a dead factory run may be reaped
without a per-instance ask ONLY after its record has been captured into a
durable ledger comment AND that comment has been VERIFIED BY READ-BACK. This
module is that procedure made mechanical, so the reconciler inherits the
authorization rather than asking for it once per run.

The read-back is not ceremony. `bd show --json` carries no comments at all,
so the obvious verification reports a successful write as lost; the comment
bodies live under `bd comments <id> --json` and, within each record, under
`text` rather than `body`. Both traps are catalogued in this repo's agent
instructions, and both would turn a real export into an apparent failure —
which is why this module reads exactly that surface and that key.

A pointer ALREADY on the item for this run id is located rather than
rewritten. Ledger comments are append-only, so a reconciler that rewrote one
per pass would grow the record without adding anything to it.

One case has no ledger comment available: an orphan whose work-item is
absent from the ledger entirely. There is no issue to comment on, so the
pointer body comes back on the outcome and the caller writes it to the
dispatch journal, which is the only durable surface left. The export still
happens BEFORE the terminate in both worlds; only its destination differs.
