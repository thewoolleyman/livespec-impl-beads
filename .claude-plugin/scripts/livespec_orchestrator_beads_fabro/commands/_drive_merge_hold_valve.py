"""The `set-merge-hold` human valve — the one policy edit that also writes the FORGE.

The other eleven valves write the ledger and stop there. The per-item merge hold
ratified in `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` cannot: the hold's whole purpose is to
put a maintainer's chosen window between dispatch and merge, and a pull request
that is ALREADY armed for auto-merge would land inside that window no matter
what the ledger says. So
setting the hold disarms an armed pull request, releasing it arms one, and that
single forge write is the action's only effect beside the label.

Which merge method the release arms is the part that must not be casual. It is
read from the DISPATCH RECORD the run journaled, never re-resolved from
`.livespec.jsonc`: the resolve-once-project-everywhere clause journals the
frozen `ResolvedIntegrationContract` with the dispatch precisely so a question
asked afterwards is answered by what the orchestrator believed THEN — and a hold
exists to make "afterwards" long enough for the configuration to have changed.

The forge is READ before either direction writes anything, because both
write-nothing refusals depend on what it says: setting a hold on an
already-merged pull request has no merge left to hold, and releasing one cannot
arm a strategy no dispatch recorded.
