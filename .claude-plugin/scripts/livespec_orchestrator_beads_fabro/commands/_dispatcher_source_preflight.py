"""Source-checkout preflight for Fabro dispatch staging safety.

THREE SANCTIONED OUTCOMES, NO FOURTH. The step proves that the base Fabro will
stage from the dispatch target is reachable from an `origin/*` ref. It passes
when it is, refuses when it is not -- and refuses when it CANNOT TELL, which is
the arm that used to be a silent skip. A path that is not a Git worktree was
previously left to the repo/workflow precondition check and the dispatch
proceeded; that is proceed-and-hope on the one question this step exists to
answer, and it is indistinguishable at the call site from a proven-clean
checkout. Absence of proof is refusal.

WHAT is looked up lives here; HOW an outcome reads lives in
`_dispatcher_source_refusals`. WHERE it is journaled is neither: the
pre-dispatch step gate owns one journal handle and appends every step's record
through it, so this module decides and says nothing about persistence.
