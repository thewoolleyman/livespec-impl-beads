"""Host-side master-CI preflight for Fabro dispatch admission safety.

ABSENCE OF PROOF REFUSES. The three fail-open cases this preflight used to
document -- no `gh` binary, no stored `gh` credential, no runs yet -- are
RETIRED: each is now an unprovable refusal naming its remedy and the committed
step-waiver escape, and a still-pending latest run refuses too rather than
proceeding on a run nobody has read yet. A host that cannot check is a host that
cannot prove the default branch green, and proceeding on that was the whole
defect (`SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`, the master-CI pipeline resolution clause).

THE BRANCH IS NEVER HARD-CODED. It is resolved per the ratified
default-branch-resolution rule, because under the retired branch literal an
adopter whose primary branch is `main` had a branch they do not have looked up
on their behalf -- and got a clean, plausible, empty answer for it.

A PRESENT-BUT-UNUSABLE DECLARATION REFUSES TOO, and refuses first, before any
git or forge read. It is the fail-open wearing a declaration's clothes: a typo
in a declared workflow name that slid onto the convention would admit the
dispatch on an unrelated pipeline's green, which is indistinguishable at the
call site from the repository's own pipeline passing.

WHAT is looked up comes from `_dispatcher_master_ci_pipeline`; the git and forge
reads come from `_dispatcher_master_ci_lookups`; HOW an outcome reads comes from
`_dispatcher_master_ci_refusals`. This module is the classifier between them.
