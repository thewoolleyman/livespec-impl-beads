"""Detection-run records on the committed detection-coverage anchor.

The detection coverage-record contract in `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` makes
detection recency RECORDED and its staleness COMPUTED, never remembered. Every
invocation of `capture-impl-gaps` or `capture-spec-drift` appends an attributed
ATTEMPT record to the repository's designated coverage anchor; a
COMPLETED-coverage record — the one that MOVES the coverage point — is appended
only when the run reached a successful terminal outcome over its declared scope
with every surfaced candidate durably disposed.

⛔ THE ALL-OR-NOTHING RULE IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT FAILS IN ONE DIRECTION.
A completed record written by a run that half-finished does not merely record
something inaccurate: it CLEARS the staleness fact derived from it, so the
convergence engine goes quiet on the strength of a pass that never happened.
The failure is silent by construction — the record looks exactly like a good
one — so the guard cannot live at the call sites, where each caller would have
to remember every disqualifying condition. It lives HERE, in
`completed_coverage_is_claimable`, and `record_detection_run` is the single
writer that consults it. A caller can only ever ASK for a completed record; it
cannot assert one.

The anchor itself is provisioned ONCE by the operator through
`capture-work-item` (consent-native) and its id is committed in
`.livespec.jsonc`. `detection_coverage_anchor` deliberately never invents one:
an unset key answers None and the writer refuses, because appending coverage
bookkeeping to a guessed id would either fail loudly against a stranger's item
or, worse, succeed against one.

THE SELF-BOOKKEEPING EXCEPTION IS SCOPED TO THIS MODULE. Appending these two
record types is the ONLY ledger write the detection operations may perform
outside their consent flows — no work-item create, no disposition, no edit of
any other record. That is enforceable by reading this file: the client seam is
reached exactly twice below, once for `add_comment` and once (through
`read_work_item_comments`) for the read-back, and both name the anchor.
