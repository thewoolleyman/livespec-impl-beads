"""How a source-checkout preflight outcome READS: its operator text and its record.

Split out of `_dispatcher_source_preflight` along the same cohesion seam its
master-CI sibling uses: DECIDING an outcome -- the git reads and the
classification -- stays there, and SAYING it is all this module does.

EVERY OUTCOME IS A RECORD HERE, including the pass. A step whose success left no
trace would make the journal unable to answer "did this step run?", which is the
question an audit of a refusal that did NOT happen has to ask. The pass is a
sanctioned outcome in its own right, so it is journaled like the other two.

AND EVERY RECORD CARRIES THE STEP IDENTIFIER. The stage name says what ran; the
step id is what a waiver entry, a degraded outcome and a clearing record all
match on, and prose is not matchable.
