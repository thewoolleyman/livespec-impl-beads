"""Literal-duration rendering of the dispatch payload's workflow graph.

WHY THE VALUES ARE WRITTEN IN RATHER THAN TEMPLATED, and why this is not
re-litigable from the source: the pinned Fabro 0.254 build types a quoted
duration attribute as a duration AT PARSE TIME, `Node::timeout` reads it
through an accessor that answers only for that type, and the template
expansion rewrites string values without ever re-typing what it rendered.
So a `timeout` templated from a workflow input renders to a STRING, the
accessor yields nothing, and the node runs with NO TIMEOUT AT ALL -- the
exact opposite of what a configurable timeout is for, with no diagnostic
anywhere. The `acp.command` attribute is a string on both sides, which is
why templating works there and cannot be copied to here.

The Dispatcher therefore renders the resolved values into the payload's own
copy of the graph as literal durations before `fabro run` sees it, and the
paired test asserts that no rendered timeout attribute carries a template
opener. See `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` section "ACP node timeouts".
