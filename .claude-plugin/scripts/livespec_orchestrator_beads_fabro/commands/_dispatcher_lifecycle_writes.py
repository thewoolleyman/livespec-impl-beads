"""The lifecycle write seam that couples a ledger disposition to its run.

THE CHOKEPOINT is `_reconcile(...)` below. Every function in this module ends
at it, and the five valves that dispose of a work-item write through this
module rather than through the store seams directly:

| valve            | entry point here                       | store seam |
| ---              | ---                                    | --- |
| close            | `close_work_item_and_reconcile`        | `append_work_item` |
| accept           | `write_work_item_status_and_reconcile` | `update_work_item_status` |
| move             | `write_work_item_status_and_reconcile` | `update_work_item_status` |
| reconcile-merged | `write_work_item_status_and_reconcile` | `update_work_item_status` |
| resolve-blocked  | `write_blocked_state_and_reconcile`    | `update_work_item_blocked_state` |

The reconciliation is a WRAPPER at this layer rather than a hook inside
`_store_mutations` / `_store_blocked_mutations` for one structural reason: the
store layer is handed a `StoreConfig` and knows nothing about factories, fabro
binaries, or the dispatch journal, and reaching from it into `commands/` would
invert the package's dependency direction. This module is the lowest layer that
can see BOTH the write and the factory, which is what makes it the seam.

It is a wrapper rather than five call-site additions for the reason
`_store_blocked_mutations` gives for owning its own label clear: an exit path
added later inherits the coupling by default instead of having to remember it.

What this module deliberately does NOT cover is any disposition that never
reaches Python — a hand `bd close`, or another repo's session moving an item.
Nothing in-process can observe those. The `orphaned-factory-run` ledger check,
the loop tick's sweep, and the systemd timer are what cover them, and they are
the fail-closed half of the invariant; this seam is the fast path, not the
guarantee.
