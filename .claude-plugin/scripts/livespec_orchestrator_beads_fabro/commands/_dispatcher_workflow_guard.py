"""Factory-branch guard for GitHub workflow file changes.

This is a FILE-SCOPED check: it SELECTS the diff files it inspects (those
under `.github/workflows/`) rather than judging the diff as a whole. So its
zero-match case is governed by the scoped-check vacuity clause and reports a
`vacuous-match` outcome rather than a pass -- see
`_dispatcher_scoped_check_vacuity` for why, and for the incident in which THIS
check passed vacuously over an empty merge for all four review rounds.

Note the shape that makes the distinction load-bearing here: this is a
PROHIBITION check, so a matched file is always a fail and its only non-failing
outcome IS vacuity. It has no pass arm to report, which is exactly why reading
its zero matches as green could never have been evidence of anything.

THE RANGE IS NEVER HARD-CODED. The branch the diff is taken against is resolved
through the shared `_dispatcher_default_branch` rule, per
`SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`'s default-branch-resolution clause. Under the
retired `origin/master...HEAD` literal an
adopter whose primary branch is `main` had this guard ask git for a range built
on a ref they do not have -- and `git diff` answers that with a fatal, which
this check reports as an unreadable diff. So the literal did not merely
mis-describe such a repository; it refused it.
