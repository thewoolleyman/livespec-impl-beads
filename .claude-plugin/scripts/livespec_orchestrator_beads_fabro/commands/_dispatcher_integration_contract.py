"""ONE governed repository's WHOLE contract, resolved once and frozen.

The sibling resolver answers ONE point: given a field descriptor and a
declaration, which of `Declared | FleetDefault | Defective` is it. This module
answers the other half of the ratified resolve-once-project-everywhere clause --
the assembly of the CLOSED FIELD SET into a single frozen object every seam then
projects off. The two change for different reasons: a newly admitted value shape
or a change to the three-arm rule is a resolver edit, while a newly ratified
FIELD is an edit here and in the schema and nowhere else.

The direction of the dependency is what keeps that separation honest. This module
imports the schema and the resolver; neither imports it. So the resolver cannot
quietly acquire knowledge of which fields exist, which is exactly the coupling
that would let a second, disagreeing assembly grow somewhere downstream.
