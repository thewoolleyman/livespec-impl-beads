"""Dispatch-target and run-stamp metadata for beads work-items.

Two facts about a dispatch live here because they share one metadata key's
fate. `dispatch_factory` names WHICH factory an item is pinned to, and it is
written twice per dispatch from two different moments: `record_dispatch_factory`
pins the target while the plan is being built, before any run exists, and
`record_dispatch_run` re-writes it with the resolved server url once the run id
is known. Splitting the two writers across modules would let the pinned factory
and the factory a run actually went to drift apart with nothing to notice.
