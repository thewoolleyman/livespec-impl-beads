"""Exception types for the expected-error surface of livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro.

Per SPECIFICATION/constraints.md (the
Result-vs-bugs split), these are the EXPECTED errors the substrate or
external input can produce. Each carries enough context for the calling
skill to surface a clear narration to the user.

Unexpected errors (caller bugs, contract violations within the plugin's
own code) raise built-in exceptions (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, etc.)
and propagate to the outermost supervisor.

These classes are plain Exception subclasses (not @dataclass) because
dataclass-frozen with Exception inheritance hits CPython's __setattr__
discipline on self.args during super().__init__().
