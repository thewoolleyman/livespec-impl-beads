"""Tests for host-side `inputs.*` substitution in the run-config overlay.

WHY THIS SURFACE EXISTS. The committed implement-work-item payload templates
its toolchain and conformance prepare steps as `{{ inputs.<name> }}`, on the
premise that the engine renders them from the `fabro run --input` pairs. The
pinned engine (fabro 0.254.0) does NOT: it renders `inputs.*` in graph node
attributes at run-create time and leaves `run.prepare` commands verbatim, so
every dispatch reached the shell as a literal `{{` and died at exit 127 before
any agent node ran.

Proven in isolation before this fix: one throwaway graph, one templated prepare
command and one templated node script reading the SAME input, created with
`fabro create --input probe_value=RENDERED_FROM_FLAG` and never started — the
node held the value, the prepare command still held the token.

The Dispatcher already materializes an uncommitted per-dispatch overlay of the
committed run config and rewrites it several ways. Substituting the resolved
contract values into that text is one more rewrite in the same place, against
the SAME already-resolved `ResolvedIntegrationContract` the `--input` pairs are
rendered from, so the two cannot drift apart. It needs no engine change.
