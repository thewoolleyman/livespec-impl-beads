"""The post-merge / reconcile janitor VENUE: the merged default-branch tip.

The venue is the target repository's default-branch tip that CONTAINS the
item's merge -- never the item's historical merge sha. Pinning it to the merge
sha deadlocks every item that merged before a janitor-environment fix landed,
because each reconcile re-provisions a checkout from before the fix existed.

The branch itself is READ OFF THE PLAN'S RESOLVED INTEGRATION CONTRACT, whose
`default_branch` field carries what the ratified two-route resolution answered
at plan build, so these cases declare it on the plan rather than queueing a
probe result for the venue to read.

Every behavioural case is driven through `post_merge`, the published entry
point both the post-merge flow and the reconcile-merged valve call, so the
assertions are about what the janitor actually provisions rather than about a
helper's return value.
