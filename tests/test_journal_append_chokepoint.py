"""Mechanical control: nothing opens the journal path for append but the layer.

The journal invoker attribution contract in `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`
requires EVERY journal write to route through the append layer
(`_dispatcher_io.JournalFile`),
because the stamped-once `invoker` / `invoker_source` guarantee governs only
what that layer actually writes. A writer that opens the journal path itself
produces a record with no attribution and no timestamp, and — this is the part
that makes a mechanical control worth having — the resulting journal looks
entirely normal. Two shipped writers did exactly that until this contract
landed, and nothing surfaced it.

So the control is structural rather than behavioural: it parses every
first-party module and refuses any append-mode `open` whose target expression
names the journal. It cannot be satisfied by a test double or a passing dispatch
— only by there being no such call site.

Scope note, because an absence claim is only as good as the population it
searched: the scan covers every `.py` under the plugin's own package tree
(`_vendor/` excluded, since vendored code is read-only and writes no journal of
ours), and it is keyed on the RECEIVER EXPRESSION rather than the mode alone —
appending to a spans file or a sink is legitimate and is not a journal write.
The positive control below proves the scan can return a hit at all, so a green
run means "no journal-append bypass exists", never "the scan found nothing
because it could not look".
