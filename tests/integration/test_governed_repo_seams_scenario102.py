"""Members-and-adopters-identical is a FAILING TEST, not prose.

Binds `SPECIFICATION/scenarios.md` Scenario 102 and the adopter-and-member-fixtures
bullet of `SPECIFICATION/constraints.md`'s governed-repository integration
constraints. Every case below is one dispatch-path seam -- preflight, contract
resolution, plan build, input rendering, workflow validation, and the sandbox's
prepare parameters with the sandbox itself stubbed -- run through PRODUCTION code
and parametrized over BOTH committed governed-repository fixtures.

WHAT THE ADOPTER LEG BUYS THAT THE MEMBER LEG CANNOT. The member fixture rests on
fleet defaults, so a fleet premise smuggled into the orchestrator agrees with it
and stays invisible; the adopter fixture declares every point through the schema
and carries none of this fleet's tooling, so the same premise has nowhere to be
read from and the seam answers with a literal the adopter never chose. That is
why the last case scans every rendered projection with the literal-ban gate's own
matcher and asserts a fleet token appears on the member leg and on NO adopter
one: an absence-assertion whose instrument is proven able to return a hit.
