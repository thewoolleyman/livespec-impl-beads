"""The typed-workflow-inputs seam check, run over a payload seeded on disk.

Binds `SPECIFICATION/scenarios.md` Scenario 100's three seam-equivalence
sub-scenarios -- a workflow token the Dispatcher renders no input for, a rendered
input no workflow position reads, and a token sitting where the pinned engine
does not expand it. Each is driven through the SHIPPED `check-seam-equivalence`
gate over a throwaway repository holding the REAL committed payload beside a
committed governed-repository declaration, so what is measured is the gate an
adopter's CI actually runs rather than a rule function taking two sets.

WHY THE GOVERNED FIXTURE IS IN SCOPE HERE. The rendered half of the equality is
`contract_run_inputs` over a contract resolved from the repository's OWN
`.livespec.jsonc`, so the check reads a governed repository on every run and the
adopter-and-member-fixtures bullet of `SPECIFICATION/constraints.md` applies:
both legs are seeded, and the clean case asserts that neither declaration
perturbs the equality -- a member resting on fleet defaults and an adopter
declaring every point through the schema must produce the SAME rendered input
NAMES, because the names are the schema's and only the values are theirs.

EVERY EDIT IS READ BACK OFF DISK BEFORE IT IS JUDGED. A `str.replace` that
matched nothing returns the original text and raises nothing, so a seeded defect
that never landed would report exactly what a conformant payload reports -- the
mutation-never-applied trap. The assertions therefore prove the persisted bytes
changed before asking the check what it makes of them.
