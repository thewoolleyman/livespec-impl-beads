"""The janitor venue is the merged default-branch tip, and it must PROVE the merge.

Binds `SPECIFICATION/scenarios.md` Scenario 98. Both cases run against a REAL
git repository built for the situation the clause exists for -- an item merged
FIRST, a janitor-environment fix landing on the default branch AFTERWARDS -- and
drive production venue resolution and production provisioning over it, so the
claim is measured on git's own answer rather than on a stubbed one. Each is
parametrized over BOTH committed governed-repository fixtures, since the venue is
a dispatch-path seam.

THE FIRST CASE CARRIES ITS OWN CONTROL, and the control is the retired design.
"The venue contains the fix" is only evidence if a venue that could NOT contain
it is distinguishable, so the same repository is provisioned twice through the
same production argv builder: once at the resolved tip, and once at the item's
historical merge sha -- the pin that made a post-fix environment repair unable to
EVER clear a pre-fix item. The first checkout carries the fix; the second cannot.
Without that second provisioning, both designs would pass the first assertion.

THE SECOND CASE IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME CLAUSE. Provisioning at the tip
keeps the guarantee the sha pin was bought with only once the tip is CONFIRMED to
contain the merge, so a tip that does not is a degraded post-merge outcome
carrying the missing point and the remedy. It is asserted through
`provision_janitor_checkout` rather than through venue resolution alone, because
"does not silently proceed" is a claim about what was NOT run: the recorded argv
list must hold the merge-presence check and NOTHING else, and no checkout may
exist on disk afterwards.
