"""Integration-tier acceptance for the ready-work aging fact.

Binds `SPECIFICATION/scenarios.md` "Scenario 84 — Aged ready work with nothing
in flight surfaces an unblock" through the real `build_attention` composition
and the real store/client seam against the in-memory `FakeBeadsClient`.

The dwell instant is seeded through the tenant metadata the store reads, not
through a stubbed reader, so the age the fact reports is derived the way a live
repository derives it. `now` is pinned rather than taken from the clock, because
an aging assertion against a moving clock is not a test.

The discriminating case is the last one: an item captured long ago that only
recently entered `ready` must NOT count as aged. Without it, a fact keyed on
`captured_at` — the obvious wrong field, and the one every record carries —
would pass every other case in this file.
