"""Guard: the six gap-operation thin bindings match the ratified naming note.

The ratified contract (`SPECIFICATION/contracts.md`) carries a Naming note on
both gap operations: `detect-impl-gaps` performs NO spec↔impl comparison — it
is a **spec-clause enumerator, not a spec→impl comparator** — so a returned
gap-id means "this clause is not yet tracked by a work-item", never "this
clause is verified absent from the implementation".

That ratification landed on the contract and the driving prose but NOT on the
thin bindings, which kept advertising `Detect spec→impl gaps`. A SKILL.md
description is not documentation a reader may skip: the harness serves it in
the skills listing every agent loads into context, so the disclaimed claim was
still the first thing any agent read about the operation. Nothing kept a
binding's front-matter in sync with the contract clause it exposes; this module
is that missing check.

It asserts BOTH directions, because only the pair is a check:

1. Every binding's description names the ratified `spec-clause enumerator`.
2. No binding's description advertises a spec-to-implementation gap
   comparison — and the detector for (2) is exercised against the literal
   pre-ratification wording, so its offending arm is proven to fire rather
   than merely never firing.
