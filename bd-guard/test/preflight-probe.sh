# preflight-probe.sh — the attended-window pre-flight check for the
# beads v1.0.5 -> v1.2.2 upgrade.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Two findings from 2026-08-21 make a pre-flight check the cheapest control
# available for this upgrade:
#
#   1. rekey-drift-fleet-probe-2026-08-21.md — the v1.2.2 upgrade runs
#      rekeyAuxRowIDs, which rewrites the primary keys of four tables. On
#      dolthub/dolt#11131 storage drift it SKIPS a table, logs three lines, and
#      lets MigrateUp exit 0. Our client discards that stderr on a zero exit,
#      so a partial re-key would pass silently. No tenant carried the drift on
#      2026-08-21, but the tenants are LIVE, so that reading is point-in-time
#      and must be retaken immediately before the migration.
#
#   2. remote-migrate-gate-does-not-fire-2026-08-21.md — the remote-migrate
#      gate keys on `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dolt_remotes > 0`, which is 0 on every
#      tenant, and the explicit ApplySchemaMigrations route passes no gate at
#      all. So nothing mechanically prevents an accidental migration; the
#      "one designated migrator" rule is a human convention only.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, per tenant
#   A. schema version   — MAX(version) in schema_migrations. Anything other than
#                         the expected baseline means a newer binary has already
#                         touched this tenant; at or above 65 is the v1.2.1
#                         landmine (AGENTS.md "Beads runtime prerequisites").
#   B. re-key drift     — forces a decode of exactly the columns auxRekeyTables
#                         reads. Any "invalid hash length" is the silent-skip
#                         trigger. LENGTH(CONCAT_WS(...)) is what forces every
#                         selected cell to materialise rather than be optimised
#                         away, so an undecodable cell raises instead of hiding.
#   C. row counts       — what the re-key would rewrite, one UPDATE each.
#   E. instrument self-check — a non-empty table whose decode sums to ZERO bytes
#                         means the expression stopped materialising cells. That
#                         failure is invisible in the drift result (it would just
#                         report clean), so it is treated as NO VERDICT (exit 2),
#                         never as a pass.
#   D. remotes          — recorded for context: 0 means the remote-migrate gate
#                         cannot fire, which is finding 2 above.
#
# READ-ONLY. Every statement is a SELECT. This installs nothing and runs no
# v1.2.x binary. One query per tenant, so it is fast enough to run inside the
# window rather than being skipped for time.
#
# USAGE
#   ./preflight-probe.sh              # check every server-mode tenant
#   ./preflight-probe.sh <repo-path>  # check one
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  every probed tenant is clean and at the expected baseline
#   1  at least one tenant FAILED a check — treat as a STOP, do not migrate
#   2  at least one tenant was UNREADABLE (no verdict) — also a stop, because a
#      missing answer is not a pass. A directory that declares server mode but
#      holds no database is SKIPPED rather than counted unreadable; that arm is
#      matched narrowly so an auth or connection failure still stops the run.
#
# LOCATION
#   Relocated here from plan/beads-v1-1-2-upgrade/research/ on 2026-08-31, after
#   the v1.0.5 -> v1.2.2 cutover it gated, so that archiving that plan does not
#   take the probe with it. It is a reusable STOP gate for any future beads
#   schema upgrade: run it with EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION set to the version every
#   tenant must currently be at (53 after the 2026-08-31 cutover). Ledger
#   comments written before the move (for example on bd-ib-ao3j) still cite the
#   old research/ path; comments cannot be edited, so this note is the redirect.
#
# MAINTENANCE
#   The column lists below are copied verbatim from auxRekeyTables in
#   internal/storage/schema/aux_row_id_backfill.go. If upstream changes that
#   table, THESE MUST CHANGE WITH IT or the probe silently checks the wrong
#   cells. Verified against v1.2.2 @ 6c124203e771.
